# Trading Management System
Welcome to Group 26 Trade System!
Run the main method in TradeSystemMain to see the text UI version of the program.


To edit the thresholds for the server in the text editor, open up the limit.csv file.
- The first number is  limitPerWeek, from the User class. This is the number of trades someone can create per week.
- The second number is the maxIncompleteTrades, from the AdminManager. This is the number of incomplete trades allowed
before the system picks the account out for admins to freeze.
- The third number is tradePrerequisite, from the AdminManager. Not in use at the moment but was supposed to be the
the number of "borrows" a person is allowed before they are unable to borrow and must lend.
